# Policy plan: pick → approach → hold → insert (draft, 2026-10-31)

Guide: the key-box study ([slides](../research/keybox_sim2real.pptx)). Status and gates roll up
into [CURRENT](../campaign/CURRENT.md). This page is the scaffold: four parts, what each must
achieve, what to explore, and how it is measured. Each part is developed and validated in sim
first; real tests start only after its sim gate passes.

## Target accuracy

91.5 % (single-arm USB-C) is not enough. The tasks the self-learning pipeline counts as solved
score 98–100 % on held-out finals (500/500 on peg insertion, toolbox, hanging; 493/500 coffee
machine); the key-box vision graph reached 496/500 (99.2 %) in sim and still failed on the real
robot until motion, perception and physics were matched. So, in sim, on held-out randomized
starts with full domain randomization:

| | Gate |
|---|---|
| Each part | ≥ 99.5 % (n ≥ 1,000, Wilson 95 % lower bound ≥ 99 %) |
| End to end (all four chained) | ≥ 98 % (n ≥ 500) |

## Shared: domain randomization (all parts, all data collection)

Every training episode and every demo is drawn from this. Seed 0 reproduces the real look.

| Group | Randomized | Range (source) |
|---|---|---|
| Arm dynamics | Coulomb friction, gravity scale | ×U(0.5, 1.3), ±0.04 (identified profile) |
| Control | action delay; encoder offsets | 0–1 control step (measured ~8 ms); ±1.5° on joints 2–5 |
| Contact | plug–port friction; pad friction and stiffness; PC-feet friction | to set; to set; μ U(0.3, 0.9) |
| Layout | PC pose; reader pose | nominal ±3 cm, ±10°; reader region 0.20 m², yaw ±90° (placement search) |
| Grasp | in-hand reader position and tilt | to set from real grasp captures (new grasp) |
| **Appearance** (slide 15) | colours of PC case, reader, table, backdrop, arms; flat to glossy; patterns on table and backdrop mixed with the real ones | per episode |
| **Lighting** (slide 15) | elevation 35–90°, intensity 0.3–1.0, 3200–6500 K, shadows half the time | per episode |
| **Camera image** (slide 15) | gain 0.93–1.07, brightness ±12, exposure ±6 %, noise | per frame |
| **Camera pose** (slides 14, 16) | extrinsic error ≥ real: ZED ≥ 4.3 mm / 0.6°, wrists ≥ 3–5 mm / 1.2° | per episode |
| Camera timing | frame age and cadence | measured cadence model |

Rule from the deck: sim sensors are at least as bad as the real ones.

## Part 1: Pick (ACT, scripted fallback)

- **Goal:** the right arm picks the reader from anywhere in its region with the **new grasp**
  and lifts it with a known, small in-hand pose spread.
- **New grasp (to confirm):** gripper as flat (parallel to the table) as possible so the reader
  stays flat; pads on the flat faces at the front of the body; plug axis orthogonal to the grasp.
- **Approach:** scripted IK expert in sim (privileged reader pose) → demos with full DR → ACT on
  wrist + ZED RGB + encoders (sim-only demos, as in task H).
- **Explore:** scripted (ZED pose estimate + IK) vs ACT; ACT chunk size and ensembling; grasp
  height/tilt; regrasp or retry on a failed grasp.
- **Metrics:** grasp success; reader still flat in hand (tilt); in-hand position spread; time.

## Part 2: Approach (IK to pre-insert)

- **Goal:** bring the held plug to a pre-insert pose a few mm in front of port 2, with an error
  inside the insertion policy's capture region.
- **Approach:** PC/port pose from the ZED (and the wrist camera near the port); in-hand reader
  pose from the wrist camera; IK to the pre-insert pose.
- **Explore:** pose estimators (ZED only, wrist only, both); a visual-servo refinement step at
  the end; how far out to stop (3–10 mm).
- **Metrics:** lateral and angular pre-insert error distribution vs the capture region of Part 4.

## Part 3: Left-arm hold

- **Goal:** the PC does not move or tip during insertion.
- **Approach:** scripted IK brace (rear face) or press (top) from the placement search, set
  before Part 2.
- **Explore:** brace vs press; target offset into the PC (holding force); timing.
- **Metrics:** PC translation/rotation during insertion; contact force; collisions with the right arm.

## Part 4: Insertion (RL)

- **Goal:** seat the plug from Part 2's pre-insert distribution despite pose errors, latency,
  encoder offsets and contact variation.
- **Baseline:** the blind proprioceptive assembly recipe (Bronars et al.): PPO, relative joint
  actions, temporal-convolution actor over joint history, contact-prediction auxiliary head,
  privileged critic; start errors at least as large as real.
- **Explore (new): what the wrist camera adds.** Variants, all with the same DR:
  (a) proprio only; (b) proprio + wrist RGB in the actor; (c) wrist RGB only for the first
  approach, proprio for contact; (d) proprio + wrist RGB + ZED. Measure success, capture region
  and robustness to larger start errors and camera pose errors.
- **Metrics:** seated rate (0.2 s hold), time to seat, PC motion, peak contact force, failure classes.

## Order of work

1. Shared DR (control, contact, appearance, lighting, camera) in the bimanual runtime.
2. Part 4 baseline (blind) from synthetic pre-insert starts → wrist-camera variants.
3. Part 3 in the GPU runtime under insertion forces.
4. Part 1 with the new grasp → Part 2 → chain all four; end-to-end gate.
5. Real: Part 4 from a hand-placed pre-insert pose, then the full chain (`real/duchamp3`).
